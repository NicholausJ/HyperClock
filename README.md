This is HyperClock, the customizable clock and weather display of the futuuuurreeee... <br>



Description:

HyperClock is a simple clock with weather and astral information displayed on any HDMI-capable 
display you want. HyperClock is a Python script running on a Raspberry Pi board. It has been 
tested to work on RPi B+, 2B, and 3B in Raspbian Wheezy and Jessie.  I am sure it could work on 
any Linux system with Python and graphic capability, though.  The reason I built it on RPi's 
with huge HDMI TV displays is because I am as blind as a bat, these days.  I have one in almost 
every room of my house, now.

Weather data is retrieved every 15 minutes over WiFi from the Yahoo Weather API. The time is 
spoken in a robotic voice, on the hour.  There is support for external temperature sensor probes.
Colors and fonts are easily configurable.

Documentation is lacking.  Please be patient.  For the impatient:
- git the code
- edit the HyperClock.conf file
- ./install.sh
- /usr/local/HyperClock/HyperClock
